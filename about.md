I am a big fan of fuctional programming and I am constatly trying to become better at it. I believe functional programming is basically a set of great practices that makes software easier to understand (also when dealing with concurrency), compose and test. Nowadays I mostly use Scala and Java 8.

I work in the core development team of [SAP Hybris Profile](https://www.yaas.io/products/saphybrisprofile.html). Every day this project makes me better at writing distributed systems that are resilient and scalable. 

I also really enjoy machine learning. Most of my experience was in the field of time series prediction and reinforcement learning. 

### More Information

I enjoy many forms of motorsport and drifting. Since 2007 I have participated in many drifting events as media, driver, organiser and a judge. My other hobbies include sim racing and playing eletric guitar.
